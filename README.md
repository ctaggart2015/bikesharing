# Bikesharing
## Overview of the analysis: 
For this challenge we are asked to use pandas to change the tripduration collum. We use the converted datatype to create the vizuals through tableau. We are asked to display the checkout Time for users, checkout time by Gender, trips by weekday per hour, trips by gender, and user trips by gender by weekday. We did this by using tableau to create worksheets to diplay the data then made it into a story.

Deliverable 1
For our data for tableau before we could start we cleaned the data. I used Juypter Notebook. I pulled up the starter then saved everything as a csv to be used for the data in tableau.
